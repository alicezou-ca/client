            <h2>Passionate and curious, Iâ€™m a second year student at the University of Victoria studying Computer Science 
                with a specification in Software Systems. I'm enthusiastic about leveraging technology to create innovative 
                solutions that make a positive impact! My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in programming
